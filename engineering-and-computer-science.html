    <h2>Exploring Computer Science</h2>
      <h4>Grade Levels: 9-12</h4>
      <h4>Prerequisites: none</h4>
      <p>This is an introductory Computer Science course that empowers students to create
        authentic artifacts and engage with Computer Science as a medium for creativity,
        communication, problem solving, and fun. Students will use computer logic to
        solve problems through the design process, discover web languages such as HTML and CSS
        to build Web sites, and program interactive games and animations while learning
        about the Internet of Things. This class should be taken by students who are interested
        in taking AP Computer Science classes.</p>
    <h2>Intro to Cybersecurity</h2>
      <h4>Grade Levels: 10-12</h4>
      <h4>Prerequisites: none</h4>
      <p>This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of coding and
        cybersecurity through hands-on modules and lessons. Students learn the fundamentals
        of programming using Python programming. The opportunities, threats, responsibilities,
        and legal constraints associated with operating in cyberspace will be discussed.
        Throughout the course, students learn the basics of electricity, programming, and networking
        as well as critical thinking skills. This course is designed to prepare students for
        higher level cyber security classes and/or employment in the field.</p>
    <h2>AP Computer Science Principles</h2>
      <h4>Grade Levels: 10-12</h4>
      <h4>Prerequisites: Algebra I</h4>
      <p>This is a rigorous, entry level course that introduces students to the foundations of modern computing.
        The course covers a broad range of topics that make up computing such as programming, algorithms, the Internet,
        big data, digital privacy and security, and the societal impacts of computing. This course will prepare
        students to take the AP exam and to complete the AP performance tasks. Students will develop and
        program a mobile app while enrolled in this class and will take the AP Exam in the Spring.</p>
    <h2>AP Computer Science A</h2>
      <h4>Grade Levels: 10-12</h4>
      <h4>Prerequisites: Algebra I</h4>

    <h2>Career Projects in Computer Science</h2>
      <h4>Grade Levels: 11-12</h4>
      <h4>Prerequisites: completion of two or more computer science courses</h4>
      <p>This is a capstone course that allows students to utilize their secondary coursework
        through a real-world work experience that will showcase their learning.
        During the first part of this course students will learn different programming languages and
        pursue industry recognized credentials. The second part of this course consists of students building
        a portfolio with real-world work experience by completing projects through app, web, or game development.
        Students will engage in an in-depth exploration of computer languages while demonstrating problem-solving,
        decision-making, and independent learning skills.</p>
