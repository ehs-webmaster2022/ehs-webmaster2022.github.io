			<h3 class="font" style="text-align: center; padding-right: 60px; padding-left: 45%; font-size: 30px; line-height: 0%;">Creed</h3>
			<p class="font" style="text-align: center; padding-right: 60px; padding-left: 45%; padding-bottom: 50px;">
				I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world.
				I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials,
				experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry,
				and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state,
				and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine.
				I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer,
				more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will
				exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind,
				I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me,
				and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p>
